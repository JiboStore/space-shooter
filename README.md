# space-shooter
An implementation of Couchbase Lite inside of Unity3D

# Requirements
- Unity 5.0.1 Personal Edition or higher
- .NET 2.0 API compatibility settings (This should be set already but sometimes it doesn't save.  Double check at Edit->Project Settings->Player Settings->Other Settings->API Compatibility Level

#Note
This will not build for web player.  Web Player puts large amounts of restrictions on the available API, some of which Couchbase Lite makes use of.
